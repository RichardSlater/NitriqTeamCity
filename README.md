======================

What is NitriqTeamCity?
-----------------------

A mechanism for extracting metrics produced by Nitriq into TeamCity to track progress or trigger build failures.

Is this something I can use?
----------------------------

At the moment I am still developing this project, much of the structure is there already; I am currently working on making the integration with TeamCity richer.
